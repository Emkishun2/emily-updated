<p> Hey! I'm Emily Devi Ramkishun. Born and raised in the laid-back village of Champagne, Guyana.
    I've found my current groove in the hustle and bustle of Hamilton, New Jersey. 
    Being an undergraduate at TCNJ is quite the journey. My major? Criminology. But wait, there's more! 
    I've also dipped my toes into the worlds of Journalism and Graphic Design as my minors. It might seem like 
    a handful, but for me, it's where the magic happens. It's about embracing the challenge, pushing boundaries,
    and discovering new passions along the way. So, here's to the late-nights fueled by cold water, mentos gum, 
    loud music and the lightbulb moments when everything clicks into place, and the excitement of diving into 
    uncharted territory. Let's face it, life's too short to stick to just one path. Here's to my journey 
    of learning, growing, and creatingâ€”because that's where the real adventure begins.
